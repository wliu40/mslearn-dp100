    "# Explore Differential Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning project typically involves an iterative process of data analyses in order to gain insights into the data and determine which variables are most likely to help build predictive models. Analyzing data usually involves aggregative and statistical functions that provide insights into the statistical distribution of variables and the relationships between them. With large volumes of data, the aggregations provide a level of abstraction; but with smaller amounts of data, or with repeated analyses, even aggregated results may reveal details about individual observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Differential privacy* is a technique that is designed to preserve the privacy of individual data points by adding \"noise\" to the data. The goal is to ensure that enough noise is added to provide privacy for individual values while ensuring that the overall statistical makeup of the data remains consistent, and aggregations produce statistically similar results as when used with the original raw data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install the SmartNoise SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "[*SmartNoise*](https://smartnoise.org/) is a toolkit from OpenDP; a joint project between researchers at Microsoft, Harvard University, and other contributors that aims to provide building blocks for using differential privacy in data analysis and machine learning projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: SmartNoise is in the early stages of development at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by installing the SmartNoise Python SDK package. You can ignore any errors about Azure CLI compatibility in this excercise."

    "- **Epsilon**: Put simplistically, *epsilon* is a non-negative value that provides an inverse measure of the amount of noise added to the data. A low epsilon results in a dataset with a greater level of privacy, while a high epsilon results in a dataset that is closer to the original data. Generally, you should use epsilon values between 0 and 1. Epsilon is correlated with another value named *delta*, that indicates the probability that a report generated by an analysis is not fully private.\n",
